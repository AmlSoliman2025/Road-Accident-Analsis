# 🚗 Road Accident Analysis – SQL + Power BI Project

This project explores road accident data using SQL for data cleaning and transformation, followed by interactive visualizations in Power BI to uncover patterns and improve road safety insights.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze accident severity across various factors
- Identify high-risk zones and conditions
- Enable filtering by weather, location, road surface, and light conditions

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, joins, filtering

- **DAX**: Measures and calculated columns for KPIs

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
- Yearly comparison of casualties (2021 vs 2022)
- Breakdown by vehicle types, accident severity, and road types
- Urban vs Rural and daylight vs darkness patterns
- Interactive filters by authority, conditions, and accident type
- Geo-map visualization for spatial analysis
  
## Insights Extracted
- Urban areas had more casualties than rural (61% vs 39%).
- Most accidents occurred during daylight and on single carriageways.
- Slight accidents dominate the severity distribution.
- Year-on-year trends show an increase in total casualties.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `sql_queries/` – Contains all SQL scripts used for analysis
- `road_accident_dashboard.pbix` – Final Power BI dashboard
- `README.md` – Project documentation
