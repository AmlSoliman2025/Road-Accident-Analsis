# 🚗 Road Accident Analysis – SQL + Power BI Project

This project explores road accident data using SQL for data cleaning and transformation, followed by interactive visualizations in Power BI to uncover patterns and improve road safety insights.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze accident severity across various factors
- Identify high-risk zones and conditions
- Enable filtering by weather, location, road surface, and light conditions

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, joins, filtering

- Urban vs Rural and daylight vs darkness patterns
- Interactive filters by authority, conditions, and accident type
- Geo-map visualization for spatial analysis

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `sql_queries/` – Contains all SQL scripts used for analysis
- `road_accident_dashboard.pbix` – Final Power BI dashboard
- `README.md` – Project documentation
